midwest |>

  summarise(num_counties = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(num_counties))
```

Wisconsin (WI) has the least amount of counties at 72.

### Question 2
```{r}
midwest |>
  count(county) |>
  filter(n == n_distinct(midwest$state))
 
```

The counties of CRAWFORD, JACKSON, and MONROE could fill in this blank as these county names appear once in each of the 5 states.

### Question 3
```{r}
# Question 3a - population density > 250000
midwest |>
  filter(popdensity > 25000) |>
  select(
    county,
    state,
    popdensity,
    poptotal,
    area
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(popdensity))
```
```{r}
# Question 3b - max population density
midwest |>
  filter(popdensity == max(popdensity)) |>
  select(
    county,
    state,
    popdensity,
    poptotal,
    area
  )
```

\newpage

### Question 4

```{r}
midwest |>
  summarise(
    normal_popdensity = median(popdensity, na.rm = TRUE),
    middle_popdensity_25 = quantile(popdensity, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    middle_popdensity_75 = quantile(popdensity, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
  
```
The distribution of population density of counties is unimodal and extremely right-skewed. A typical Midwestern county has population density of 1156 people per unit area. The middle 50% of the counties have population densities between 622 to 2330 people per unit area.
